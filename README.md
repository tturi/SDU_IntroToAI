# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Sokoban solvers
The uploaded solvers has two different algorithms utilized. Both code is lacking automation and require to hardcode the Sokoban map into its code. Also it is following Concept 2 in the enclosed picture, therefore it cannot be used straigth to solve classic Sokoban maps with these algorithms. Also I have uploaded a Lego Mindstorm EV3 microPython line follower script.

## A* search implementation
Codes I would like to publish for my reports during study at SDU
## Lego Mindstorm EV3 line follower script
#### Lego_line_follower.py
It is a far from perfect line following algorith written in microPython (see more info about the implementation: https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3
and about the poor performance of the code :)
