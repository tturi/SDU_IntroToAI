# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Sokoban task
The uploaded solvers has two different algorithms utilized. Both code is lacking automation and require to hardcode the Sokoban map into its code. Another thing to know that it was made for the purpose of assignment, and the code does not follow clear code requirements (i.e. oversized lines, using variables ease reading the code etc.) Also it is following Concept 2 in the enclosed picture (Classic_vs_implemented_concept_of_operation), therefore it cannot be used straigth to solve classic Sokoban maps with these scripts as the bool conditions for ending searching a node in the graphs are different then for a normal Sokoban. However it could be changed to "normal" Sokoban rules easily. Also I have uploaded a Lego Mindstorm EV3 microPython line follower script, which executes the code on a map.

It is a far from perfect line following algorith written in microPython (see more info about the implementation: https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3
